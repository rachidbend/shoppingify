## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mGd5VpbO4JnzU6I9l96x) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

My goal was to create this project with as much attention to details as possible, i wanted the functionality to be complete, the styling to be as close to the original design as possible, and i wanted to add animations to make it feel responsive and dynamic, to give a great feel to the project.

For the styling, i had to take some liberties to make sure it looks good and functions well for all devices (i.e phones, tabletsn small to large laptops, and desktops).
